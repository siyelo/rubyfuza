					%p In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

					%p A business consultancy turned software house.
					%p What may seem a strange transition was a rather natural evolution that has spanned the last 8 years. Mpowered started as a BEE consulting service. A few years in, we began development on a scorecard calculation tool that grew to become our flagship software product. At the time we had little idea that inside of four years our business would fundamentally shift from selling consulting to selling software.
					%p Today we develop web apps that help businesses track, measure and plan BEE compliance. We also enjoy exploring associated domains and other ideas that resonate with our techy hearts :)
