            %h2 Legacy CodeRetreat
            %p There used to be a sentiment that "real programmers" only do green-fields projects. Nowadays we know that's simply false: rescuing and improving legacy code bases are some of the most important and hardest tasks that we face as software engineers.
            %p The Legacy Coderetreat follows the same format as the very well known Coderetreat but with a twist. Developers will be working with an existing piece of code.
            %p This is a hands-on practice event, where we will try out various legacy refactoring techniques. We will have fun trying to revive a terrible piece of code, in a stress-free environment.

            %p I'm a Software Engineer who cares deeply about delivering pragmatic solutions. Most of my 10+ years of experience has been in developing crucial font-end applications, specifically in the financial industries: online trading, online banking and insurance. Lately I divide my time between developing awesome startup products, and coaching software development teams of all shapes and sizes on building the right products, well.

            %p I'm a software developer who spends most of my time coaching and mentoring software teams to help them master their craft. During my career I've contributed to projects ranging from mobile apps, data analytics, high volume systems integration to mission-critical systems. The most notable projects directly affected the South African economy and democracy. Programming makes me happy. When not coaching I spends my time building software products on anything from C#, ObjC, node.js or Ruby.

        %p Ansible deployments for fun and profit with Steven Ringo

            %p Deployments are hard. There are many moving parts and a complex lifecycle.
            %p From provisioning servers to managing dependencies and deploying code, while keeping it secure, automated and up-to-date is a daunting task.
            %p Ansible is conceptually simple yet incredibly powerful IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates. Its beautiful in its elegance of operation. A joy to use, and has a friendly and supportive community.
            %p Steven has used Ansible successfully in a number of different environments (many on Ruby) and turned deployment from an error-prone nightmare to something trivial and confident.
            %p This workshop aims to provide an overview of Ansible that will show you how to confidently deploy your ruby apps and servers and have some fun doing it.
            %p We'll focus on ruby/rails and rack app deployments as well as how to provision servers running on cloud providers such as AWS and DigitalOcean.

            %p Dataflow variables fall in the same category as Futures, Promises and I-Vars.
            %p Dataflow concurrency is a simple but powerful idea. It rests on single-assignment variables with blocking semantics (dataflow variables). Any thread attempting to use an unbound variable will wait until another thread assigns a value to it.
            %p Deterministic dataflow is a form of functional programming.

/             %p Amazon Web Services is pleased to present a workshop in Cape Town the weekend before the Rubyfuza conference. The hack-day will provide hands-on experience designing and building a fun distributed application using AWS services.
/             %p The workshop is aimed at seasoned developers. Prior experience using AWS and our SDKs will be to your advantage; however they are well documented and easy to learn in the time you have available.
/             %p We'll be building a procedural music generator. You'll build up a library of sound samples by interacting with a variety of AWS services, learning AWS best practices along the way, and combine those samples into a piece of music.
/             %p Engineers from AWS will be on hand to help you design and build your system. They'll be doing the judging and will award some great prizes for the best piece of music, and the most creative applications.
/             %p We will credit your AWS account with enough money to build your application, as well as play with AWS services after the workshop.
/             %h4 Prerequisites:
/             %ul.list
/               %li Your own AWS account - this requires a credit-card, and it will not be possible to sign up for an account on the day. Please don't use one from your employer!
/               %li A laptop with a development environment for your favourite language already configured
/             %p
/               It's important that you sign up for an AWS account before the event - please drop us an email at

/       %h2 An Introduction to Functional Programming for Ruby Developers
/       %p There is a lot of buzz and hype around functional programming at the moment.  Many claiming it is the only way to scale and write safe code in our multi-core world.  Some of it is true and some of it is hype.  What I've learnt is that functional programming makes us better object oriented developers.  On more than one occasion, FP has offered us a cleaner, sweeter solutions to non-trivial problems.  In this workshop, we will give a hands-on introduction to the main themes of FP, cutting through the hype, favouring practice over theory.  We will play with a few languages like Clojure, Scala, JavaScript (yes!) and maybe Haskell or F# too.  So bring your laptop along and join in.

/         Aslam Khan is a software developer for more years than South Africa is a democracy.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code as an expression of design. And the same goes for architecture too - it's all design.  The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very hard.  As developers we need thinking tools, and different paradigms gives us that diversity, hence his interest in functional programming.  He is currently writing a book on functional programming for Manning.  If that doesn't bore you, then try his blog at

Functional Programming offers some powerful tools, techniques and perspectives, towards achieving "soft" code. Ryan loves learning and facilitating learning in others.

/       %p Most software companies are trying some form of an agile process these days, but often people follow the mechanics without understanding the reasons behind why certain things are done.
/       %p Join us for a Scrum simulation using LEGO. We will build a product that needs to ship at the end of 2 sprints. We’ll go through each of the Scrum meetings: Backlog Grooming, Sprint Planning parts 1 & 2, Sprint Review and Sprint Retro. First we’ll explain the purpose of the meeting so you understand the reason for doing it, then you’ll get to do it, re-enforcing the learning.
/       %p Even if you’ve been doing Scrum for some time, this will be a great refresher of the basics and an opportunity to ask questions about some of the subtleties of Scrum.
