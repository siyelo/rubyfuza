            <h3>Ruby: Where Are You Going?</h3>
            <p>A look at the past, present and future of web development in Ruby. How does Rails work internally? What is going to happen in Rails 4? What are the plans for Sinatra? Right now, there are at least two replacements for Rack in the makings. But it is the underlying technology used by Rails, Sinatra and nearly any other Ruby web framework out there. Yet, it's the framework authors pushing for the changes. So, what's wrong with Rack? And what does that mean for us as web developers?</p>

            <p>Renée is the Chief Adventure Officer at a small RoR consultancy in Seattle WA USA called NIRD: Northwest Independent Ruby Development. She has been teaching Ruby, Rails, and everything else for the last couple of years to new programmers, experienced programmers, and sometimes to both at the same time! She is teaching the Ruby section of the University of Washington's Ruby on Rails Certificate program, and does RailsBridge workshops whenever she can. Her corporate trainings and paying clients take up the rest of the time that she's not traveling the world to speak at really cool conferences in really cool places!</p>
            <h3>Teaching Ruby for Fun and Profit!</h3>
            <p>How many companies are hiring Ruby developers right now? How many are finding qualified candidates? Why aren't workers swarming into our industry to fill up all these empty developer positions? Is learning Ruby really that hard? Why is learning Ruby so hard? Isn't it a language built by people for people? Shouldn't that be easy for anyone to pickup and use? Why isn't everyone building Ruby apps? I'm going to tell you. The good, the bad, and the goofy of trying to teach Ruby, Rails, and everything else we take for granted as RoR developers. There may even be a guest appearance from a real life Ruby Newbie to demonstrate!</p>

            <p>I realized I wanted to learn practical programming skills so once I found out about Ruby in college I immediately installed Locomotive on my Mac. Was extremely excited to find out I already had Ruby 1.8.6 preinstalled on my iBook G4 and started hacking on my first Rails project. I find teaching to be enjoyable and have been participating in the SF RailsBridge every so often. I'm still a level 1 whiskey/whisky drinker, but I'm working on that. Currently I am working at GitHub doing cool stuff.</p>
            <h3>Don't Be an A**hole</h3>
            <p>Ruby is now 18 years old. It has become a very mature project and the developers that have been using it are a lot more mature now as well. Our community has long since crossed the chasm and we are in the early majority stage. This means that even though we have many people who are well versed in the language we are again having an influx of new people. I want to help those new people feel comfortable enough to believe they can learn and become just as mature as the oldies who are part of the community. Also, I want to educate the oldies on how they can better help out these newbies.</p>
            <p>The Ruby community has become very much like any other close-knit community. We are very biased towards certain philosophies such as agile development, pair programming, and TDD. Some might compare our community to other close-knit organizations such as fraternities/sororities, athletic clubs and the freemasons. They all have very idealistic philosophies they run their organizations on. I want to show how we compare to these types of organizations. I want to highlight the good things we adopted from running our community this way as well as the bad. I want to show how we can improve and fix the bad habits so that we can create a more open community for new people to join and feel welcomed.</p>

            <p>Software licensing sets up rules for everyone to follow when contributing or using code. Some companies have specific policies on what types of licenses are compatible with their code base. Other companies put rules on their developers on how they're allowed to contribute code to software. Do you license your software? This talk will review some popular open source software licenses and considerations you should make before contributing code. It's good to be aware of these rules before you end up on the wrong side of a Cease and Desist order.</p>

            <p>Lance has been a computer nut ever since his dad bought him a VIC 20 in the 80's. For a number of years he was working in Java for large companies such as CNN, Kodak and GE. Then one day about four years ago he did a self intervention and decided to end his addiction to heavy inheritance, static typing and coding without tests. These days he a committer on projects such as Adhearsion practicing clean Ruby living with lots of well-tested code, class composition and fun dynamic languages as a startup CTO and freelance developer. When he's not writing Ruby you will find him diving with sharks, trekking through a rain forest, wine tasting or freaking out his neighbors with his ARDrone.</p>
            <h3>Dynamic Routing with Circuit</h3>
            <p>Rails and Rack both have mechanisms to route requests. They are powerful, and offer some dynamic routing if you want to route within Rails. But what if you need to dynamically route requests to multiple Rack based applications? What if you want to control that routing dynamically with a database? Circuit allows you to do that. In this talk will explore the basics of Rack Middleware and Routing. Then we will show you how Circuit can help you to take Rack routing to the next level dynamically with lots of traffic.</p>

            <p>Abstraction is like alcohol: a little is nice; a little more is a little nicer. A lot is a headache. Is it really worth writing one line when you can write 3? Or 8? As a consumer, when is finding the right gem harder than just writing it yourself? Some examples of over-gemmification and a few lines of code that do what you need. As a producer, what does it take to get your code ready to be released as a gem? It's turtles all the way down. Unless you make some assumptions for them to stand on.</p>

Automating deployment, graphing, monitoring, provisioning, tweeting, and many other things with Hubot has enabled and enhanced our culture of remote work. We're standardizing how we interact with the applications and servers that run GitHub by continuously expanding our library of Hubot commands that any GitHubber can run in multiple Campfire chat rooms. Interacting with Hubot in the middle other of conversations has increased our awareness of what other GitHubbers are working on and the speed at which new team members learn common practices. In this talk, I'll give examples of how we deploy and interact with github.com via Hubot, describe benefits we've seen from this approach, and describe how you can bring ChatOps into your daily workflow.</p>

            <p>Writing modern web applications requires a ton of JS, and somewhere in that JS lies some application logic (we're not just talking DOM manipulations here). If you require that same logic on the server-side for say, generating reports, what do you do?

            <p>This talk is about more than Unicorns. This is a scary talk about scary Ruby internals. Disregard the Unicorns, actually. There's a lot going on under the hood in MRI, YARV and Rubinius. The C and C++ layer that interacts with the OS is a tangly mess full of tricky bugs and arcane issues; the kind of issues that don't raise exceptions, but kill whole processes and make them bleed rainbows. Every time one of these "glitter bullets" kills a Ruby process, I shed a small tear: This is a talk about how we discover, tackle and fix these kind of issues at GitHub, to ensure our servers are always up and serving requests.</p>

            <h3>Developing multiple personalities to bootstrap your first product</h3>
            <p>Ready, set, launch, (...crickets...). The tale of many a developer-turned-product-launcher, including me. But after a false start, I launched Classroom 7, a learning management system for trainers, which is now well on its way to paying the bills. Bootstrapping a product requires a bit of a multiple personality disorder - you’ve got to be a dreamer, engineer, critic, bank manager and sales exec all rolled into one. In this talk I'll share some of the lessons I've learned during the product launching journey and talk about some of the pitfalls that should be avoided when launching a product. Everyone has the ability to bootstrap a successful product, you've just got to start out right. This talk will set you on the right path.</p>

            <h3>Side-effects are not your friend</h3>
            <p>Functional Programming is more than a set of language features. It's a style of thinking, a way of doing things.</p>
            <p>Ruby gives us access to some aspects of the Functional style through lambdas, blocks, procs, and array iterators.</p>
            <p>But the most profound way in which Functional thinking can change your Ruby day comes down to a core issue of Functional Programming: "side-effects". Ruby places no restriction on leaving side-effects - it comes down to the choice (and then discipline) of the Rubyist to refrain from doing so.</p>
            <p>Side-effect-free code is more easily testable, and more predictable than side-effect-ridden code.</p>
            <p>In this talk I'll show you some of the many ways in which side-effects cause you pain and suffering, and techniques and strategies of leaving less of them in your wake.</p>

            <h3>`bundle install` Y U SO SLOW: Server Edition</h3>
            <p>If you've ever done anything in ruby, you've probably used rubygems and rubygems.org to search or install your favorite gem. On October 17, 2012, rubygems.org went down. A Dependency API was built to be used by Bundler 1.1+ to speed up `bundle install`. Unfortunately, it was a bit too popular and the service caused too much load on the current infrasture. In order to get rubygems.org back up the API had to be disabled. You can watch the post-mortem, http://youtu.be/z73uiWKdJhw, for details.</p>
            <p>Members in the community stepped up and built a compatible Dependency API service called the Bundler API. Working with the rubygems.org team, we were able to bring the API up for everyone within a week. In this talk, I will cover the process we went through of extracting the API out into a separate Sinatra app that now runs on Heroku. I'll go over how the API works and how Bundler itself uses it. Since we don't have direct access to their database, we needed to build a syncing service to keep our local cache up to date. We'll discuss the original sequential implementation of the sync code and how we improved performance through the use of a consumer thread pool. The sync time down was cut from 16 mins to 2-3 mins. Next, we'll talk about the productization steps we took for visibility to make sure the app is performing well.</p>
            <p>We're prototyping a replay service, to replay production traffic to different Heroku apps. With this we can compare the performance between the current MRI app in production and the same app running on JRuby. This will also allow us to test any changes/features against real production load. We'll go over how to set this up.</p>

            <p>I'm a developer making peace with the fact that I dropped out of a Lisp class in high school because I figured that nobody in their right mind would ever write code like that.  Nowadays, I spend my time cracking really hard nuts, not P=NP hard, just very complex hard.  Sometimes, I contribute a bit to the agile software community by offering tissues at conferences to Scrum people who just realized that certification and time boxes were not all that it was cracked out to be. I also help insomniacs with my rather soporific blog at f3yourmind.net.</p>
            <h3>Not Quite Object Oriented</h3>
            <p>Ruby is a language, just a tool for a developer to build software. To use this tool effectively, the programmer must be familiar with object orientated programming. Object orientation is a paradigm, not a tool.  It is a very specific world view based on underlying theories.  Embracing this world view is a serious choice.  It means that the developer is obliged to think in a very specific way.  Nowadays, many Ruby developers also use other tools like JavaScript and CoffeeScript. These languages are not from the same world as Ruby.  They are from another paradigm - functional programming.  Functional programming is a different world view, based on different underlying theories.  Trying to use a tool from one world when your head is wired for the other world just results in is a code base that is messy and very expensive.</p>
            <p>Since we are using these functional tools, we really do need to understand this world. So, what does this functional world look like?  How are functional minds wired?</p>
            <p>In this talk, I will take you on a whirlwind tour of functional programming concepts.  You will see lots of code snippets in lots of different languages. My objective is simple - a tour guide view that will point out places of interest that you can explore at your leisure.  In the end, I hope we will make smaller messes.</p>

            <p>Stuart is a Cape Town based developer who fell in love with Ruby in 2007 and has been his passion since.</p>
            <p>Before then he was stuck in an unhealthy relationship with Delphi, and had courted PHP and C#. He is crazy about clean and minimalist design, photography and good beer.</p>
            <p>In a past life he's pretty sure he wore a cape.</p>

            <p>I will be discussing the decision behind the abstraction, how we approached it and where a handful of gems made the process a whole lot easier.</p>

    <p>Cape Town’s business centre is within easy walking distance from the Strand Tower Hotel.</p>
    <p>The city’s many major tourist attractions, such as Table Mountain, Robben Island and the V&A Waterfront, are also within easy access from the hotel. Other notable landmarks nearby include the Cape Town International Convention Centre, which is just 2 kilometers away, and the Green Point Stadium, which was constructed for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The stadium, which is 3.5 kilometers from the hotel, is now home to many other major sports tournaments.</p>

          <p>In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.</p>

          <p>A business consultancy turned software house.</p>
          <p>What may seem a strange transition was a rather natural evolution that has spanned the last 8 years. Mpowered started as a BEE consulting service. A few years in, we began development on a scorecard calculation tool that grew to become our flagship software product. At the time we had little idea that inside of four years our business would fundamentally shift from selling consulting to selling software.</p>
          <p>Today we develop web apps that help businesses track, measure and plan BEE compliance. We also enjoy exploring associated domains and other ideas that resonate with our techy hearts :)</p>
