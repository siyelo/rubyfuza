            <p>Alex Coles is a freelance web developer, unabashedly wearing the hat of "generalist". He is active in the Ruby community, having founded the annual eurucamp camp/conference in Berlin. He has also contributed extensively to many open-source projects including RefineryCMS and DataMapper.</p>
            <h3>Find Simplicity With Plain Old Ruby Objects</h3>
            <p>This talk will discuss why you might, when you set out to design a system, want to stop thinking about persistence. Rather than kicking off a project generating models that subclass ActiveRecord::Base, I will suggest beginning your application development by modelling behaviour with Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs).</p>
            <p>While including ideas from Avdi Grimm's Objects on Rails, the talk will primarily be based around my personal experience refactoring an-ActiveResource based system with Plain Old Ruby Objects and roar.</p>
            <p>Included in this talk will be an exploration of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>patterns, such as Repository and Data Mapper, as coined by Martin Fowler,</li>
              <li>how upcoming libraries &eldash; Curator, DataMappify, ROM.rb and Veritas &eldash; fit in with these patterns,</li>
              <li>the parts of these libraries that are usable today,</li>
              <li>how to make this methodology workable in the context of TDD (keeping components as testable as possible).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There will also be a discussion about the stage when you should begin implementing persistence.</p>

            <h3>Extreme Makeover: Rubygems Edition</h3>
            <p>Rubygems.org provides every Rubyist with an amazing service: all the libraries in the Ruby world. As amazing as that is, installing gems can be a time-consuming and even error-prone process. (Just ask the Travis guys.) In this talk, you'll learn about the recent dramatic changes in Rubygems and Bundler to improve speed and reliability by rewriting the Rubygems client/server architecture. I'll show how the new system caches more information, makes fewer requests, and takes less time to install gems. Finally, I'll cover how the changes allow worldwide mirrors of rubygems.org, improving things for Rubyists around the globe.</p>

            <p>I've been programming in Ruby and Ruby on Rails since late 2004 when the first 15 minute blog video hit the web. Forever changed by that brief introduction to Rails, I've spent the last 9 years honing my craft. I eventually found myself at thoughtbot where I currently spread the knowledge of Ruby to others by teaching workshops both online and in person.</p>
            <h3>The Art of Ruby</h3>
            <p>We should all be artists in our craft, but there is a balance between expressiveness and performance. This talk is about finding that balance and producing beautiful code that doesn't sacrifice syntax for speed. I'll explore real world examples of code and mold them into something far more expressive. During the process we'll take a look at how common design patterns are applied to larger applications and examine the repercussions.</p>

          <div class='inner'>
            <p>Daniel Schierbeck has been programming in Ruby since 2005 after completing level 99 in PHP and figuring out there was no prize to win after all.</p>
            <p>He studied Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, where he primarily spent his time trying to avoid writing C++. He got into Concurrent Sequential Processes before it became cool, and wrote a Ruby implementation called Minx for his bachelor thesis. As with all academic code, it is used by no one.</p>
            <p>He currently pumps out pull requests for a living at Zendesk, a San Francisco based Customer Support Software SaaS company.</p>
            <h3>Curly — Refactoring the view layer</h3>
            <p>While most parts of Rails have been thoroughly overhauled during the past few years, one part has stubbornly refused improvement. The view layer is still by default using ERB to transform your app’s objects into HTML. Though HAML has gained a lot of traction, it is not a fundamental shift away from ERB, but rather a preference for putting HTML in your Ruby rather than the other way around.</p>
            <p>More recent efforts in the realm of JavaScript have produced Mustache and its ambitious younger brother, Handlebars. While these are more radical in their attempt to separate structure and logic, they still do not feel like native Rails code.</p>
            <p>While trying to solve a seemingly unrelated problem we discovered a design that suddenly enabled us to move past the limitations of ERB. Though different only in subtle ways, it struck just the right balance between integration with Rails and separation of concerns. We called it Curly.</p>
            <p>I will show how we use the same old OO techniques that you already know to clean up our views, making them less prone to bugs, more readable, and more reusable.</p>
            <p>I’ll also show how a seemingly small change of our conceptual model enabled us to add advanced behavior to our view layer without ending with an unmaintainable mess.</p>
            <p>Curly is open source and available at http://github.com/zendesk/curly</p>

            <p>Lance has been a computer nut ever since his dad bought him a VIC 20 in the 1980s. After nearly a decade as a Java developer for companies like Kodak, CNN, and GE, he decided to end his addiction to heavy inheritance, static typing, and coding without tests. These days, he practices clean Ruby living with lots of well-tested code, class composition, and fun dynamic languages as a developer/startup CTO for hire with extensive experience in data science and committer on open source projects such as the Passbook-iOS, Asari and Active Asari Gems. He is known to practice interspecies pair (purr) programming with his orange tabby, Allie, and when he's not writing code, you will find him diving with sharks, trekking through Chernobyl, sampling wine, cheering on the Springboks or perfecting his biltong recipe.</p>
            <h3>Analytics for the Busy Ruby Developer</h3>
            <p>Our applications have the potential to produce a lot of data. Every time a user clicks a button, buys something, or our application does any number of things we have the opportunity to gain useful insights. But where do you begin? Should I gather every data point I can think of? What tools work the best? There is a lot of talk and hype about analytics. In this session, let's take a look at what goes into mining data and analyzing the insights. We'll discuss different approaches to gathering, storing, and querying data, how to determine the KPIs to focus on, and how to interpret and use information in meaningful ways. While you may not be a statistician, see how some basic statistics can help you to start to wrangle your data.</p>

            <p>Newcomer or seasoned veteran looking to get involved with Ruby documentation?</p>
            <p>The path to eternal gratification can seem like a scary one, but we'll show you it's alot easier than you thought. Writing documentation is a great way to give back to the open source community and build your Ruby skills and fundamentals.</p>
            <p>This talk will teach you the value of open-source, the benefits of contributing, and a little bit about how ruby-core works. You will learn what to look for when spotting documentation bugs in the CRuby source code. We will cover the guidelines to writing CRuby documentation, and how to submit a patch.</p>

Automating deployment, graphing, monitoring, provisioning, tweeting, and many other things with Hubot has enabled and enhanced our culture of remote work. We're standardizing how we interact with the applications and servers that run GitHub by continuously expanding our library of Hubot commands that any GitHubber can run in multiple Campfire chat rooms. Interacting with Hubot in the middle other of conversations has increased our awareness of what other GitHubbers are working on and the speed at which new team members learn common practices. In this talk, I'll give examples of how we deploy and interact with github.com via Hubot, describe benefits we've seen from this approach, and describe how you can bring ChatOps into your daily workflow. -->

A Dependency API was built to be used by Bundler 1.1+ to speed up `bundle install`. Unfortunately, it was a bit too popular and the service caused too much load on the current infrasture. In order to get rubygems.org back up the API had to be disabled. You can watch the post-mortem, http://youtu.be/z73uiWKdJhw, for details. -->
    <!-- %p Members in the community stepped up and built a compatible Dependency API service called the Bundler API. Working with the rubygems.org team, we were able to bring the API up for everyone within a week. In this talk, I will cover the process we went through of extracting the API out into a separate Sinatra app that now runs on Heroku. I'll go over how the API works and how Bundler itself uses it. Since we don't have direct access to their database, we needed to build a syncing service to keep our local cache up to date. We'll discuss the original sequential implementation of the sync code and how we improved performance through the use of a consumer thread pool. The sync time down was cut from 16 mins to 2-3 mins. Next, we'll talk about the productization steps we took for visibility to make sure the app is performing well. -->
    <!-- %p We're prototyping a replay service, to replay production traffic to different Heroku apps. With this we can compare the performance between the current MRI app in production and the same app running on JRuby. This will also allow us to test any changes/features against real production load. We'll go over how to set this up. -->

Object orientation is a paradigm, not a tool.  It is a very specific world view based on underlying theories.  Embracing this world view is a serious choice.  It means that the developer is obliged to think in a very specific way.  Nowadays, many Ruby developers also use other tools like JavaScript and CoffeeScript. These languages are not from the same world as Ruby.  They are from another paradigm - functional programming.  Functional programming is a different world view, based on different underlying theories.  Trying to use a tool from one world when your head is wired for the other world just results in is a code base that is messy and very expensive. -->

    <p>Cape Town’s business centre is within easy walking distance from the Strand Tower Hotel.</p>
    <p>The city’s many major tourist attractions, such as Table Mountain, Robben Island and the V&A Waterfront, are also within easy access from the hotel. Other notable landmarks nearby include the Cape Town International Convention Centre, which is just 2 kilometers away, and the Green Point Stadium, which was constructed for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The stadium, which is 3.5 kilometers from the hotel, is now home to many other major sports tournaments.</p>

    <!-- %p In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. -->

          <p>
            Polyglot Programming is an Atlanta based software company with strong
            South African ties. Managing partners Lance and Marlene, an
            ex-Pretorian, lead a team of developers who are passionate about Ruby
            on Rails and other best in breed technologies. We work with startups
            and companies to develop prototypes, launch ideas, scale existing web
            applications and supplement internal development teams. Our Agile
            development process focuses on testing and ensures that we deliver
            feature-rich applications quickly and within budget. When they're not
            writing code, you'll find the team "purr programming" with resident
            company cat Allie or sampling wine and cheering for the Springboks.

          <p>Wow, I can't believe it's been more than six months since Rubyfuza. And that means it's less than six months until the next one. Well, we've started planning and things will start coming together slowly over the next few weeks..</p>

          <p>My wife asked me "What are you most excited about at this year's conference?" That's a really tough question for me to answer, but I think the thing that I'm most excited about are the RailsBridge workshops...</p>
