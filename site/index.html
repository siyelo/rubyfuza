We're standardizing how we interact with the applications and servers that run GitHub by continuously expanding our library of Hubot commands that any GitHubber can run in multiple Campfire chat rooms. Interacting with Hubot in the middle other of conversations has increased our awareness of what other GitHubbers are working on and the speed at which new team members learn common practices. In this talk, I'll give examples of how we deploy and interact with github.com via Hubot, describe benefits we've seen from this approach, and describe how you can bring ChatOps into your daily workflow. -->

A Dependency API was built to be used by Bundler 1.1+ to speed up `bundle install`. Unfortunately, it was a bit too popular and the service caused too much load on the current infrasture. In order to get rubygems.org back up the API had to be disabled. You can watch the post-mortem, http://youtu.be/z73uiWKdJhw, for details. -->
    <!-- %p Members in the community stepped up and built a compatible Dependency API service called the Bundler API. Working with the rubygems.org team, we were able to bring the API up for everyone within a week. In this talk, I will cover the process we went through of extracting the API out into a separate Sinatra app that now runs on Heroku. I'll go over how the API works and how Bundler itself uses it. Since we don't have direct access to their database, we needed to build a syncing service to keep our local cache up to date. We'll discuss the original sequential implementation of the sync code and how we improved performance through the use of a consumer thread pool. The sync time down was cut from 16 mins to 2-3 mins. Next, we'll talk about the productization steps we took for visibility to make sure the app is performing well. -->
    <!-- %p We're prototyping a replay service, to replay production traffic to different Heroku apps. With this we can compare the performance between the current MRI app in production and the same app running on JRuby. This will also allow us to test any changes/features against real production load. We'll go over how to set this up. -->

Object orientation is a paradigm, not a tool.  It is a very specific world view based on underlying theories.  Embracing this world view is a serious choice.  It means that the developer is obliged to think in a very specific way.  Nowadays, many Ruby developers also use other tools like JavaScript and CoffeeScript. These languages are not from the same world as Ruby.  They are from another paradigm - functional programming.  Functional programming is a different world view, based on different underlying theories.  Trying to use a tool from one world when your head is wired for the other world just results in is a code base that is messy and very expensive. -->

    <p>Cape Town’s business centre is within easy walking distance from the Strand Tower Hotel.</p>
    <p>The city’s many major tourist attractions, such as Table Mountain, Robben Island and the V&A Waterfront, are also within easy access from the hotel. Other notable landmarks nearby include the Cape Town International Convention Centre, which is just 2 kilometers away, and the Green Point Stadium, which was constructed for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The stadium, which is 3.5 kilometers from the hotel, is now home to many other major sports tournaments.</p>

    <!-- %p In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. -->
