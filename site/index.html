            <p>Charlene is a developer who has recently started questioning whether there is really such a thing called devops.

            <h3>Software Development in Africa</h3>
            <p>Software development has gone through many upheavals and downhills to what it is currently. Still, it remains an impressive creation that is changing the lifestyles of many. Africa, on the other side, has a history that is yet to fully captivate many of its own people. So what could “software development” and “Africa” be doing in the same phrase?</p>
            <p>Being passionate about code and enjoying a love-hate relationship with my continent, I will share how these words resonate with me. I will discuss some of the achievements and also challenges of developing software in Africa, my fears and hopes too. Let’s have a conversation on what these words mean for us; software development and Africa put together.</p>

He has also contributed extensively to many open-source projects including RefineryCMS and DataMapper.</p>
            <h3>Find Simplicity With Plain Old Ruby Objects</h3>
            <p>This talk will discuss why you might, when you set out to design a system, want to stop thinking about persistence. Rather than kicking off a project generating models that subclass ActiveRecord::Base, I will suggest beginning your application development by modelling behaviour with Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs).</p>
            <p>While including ideas from Avdi Grimm's Objects on Rails, the talk will primarily be based around my personal experience refactoring an-ActiveResource based system with Plain Old Ruby Objects and roar.</p>
            <p>Included in this talk will be an exploration of:</p>
            <ul class='list'>
              <li>patterns, such as Repository and Data Mapper, as coined by Martin Fowler,</li>
              <li>how upcoming libraries &eldash; Curator, DataMappify, ROM.rb and Veritas &eldash; fit in with these patterns,</li>
              <li>the parts of these libraries that are usable today,</li>
              <li>how to make this methodology workable in the context of TDD (keeping components as testable as possible).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There will also be a discussion about the stage when you should begin implementing persistence.</p>

            <h3>Extreme Makeover: Rubygems Edition</h3>
            <p>Rubygems.org provides every Rubyist with an amazing service: all the libraries in the Ruby world. As amazing as that is, installing gems can be a time-consuming and even error-prone process. (Just ask the Travis guys.) In this talk, you'll learn about the recent dramatic changes in Rubygems and Bundler to improve speed and reliability by rewriting the Rubygems client/server architecture. I'll show how the new system caches more information, makes fewer requests, and takes less time to install gems. Finally, I'll cover how the changes allow worldwide mirrors of rubygems.org, improving things for Rubyists around the globe.</p>

            <p>I've programming in Ruby and Ruby on Rails since late 2004 when the first 15 minute blog video hit the web. Forever changed by brief introduction to Rails I've spent the last 9 years honing my craft. I eventually found myself at thoughtbot where I currently spread the knowledge of Ruby to others by teaching workshops both online and in person.</p>
            <h3>The Art of Ruby</h3>
            <p>We should all be artists in our craft, but there is a balance between expressiveness and performance. This talk is about finding that balance and producing beautiful code that doesn't sacrifice syntax for speed. I'll explore real world examples of code and mold them into something far more expressive. During the process we'll take a look at how common design patterns are applied to larger applications and examine the repercussions.</p>

          <div class='inner'>
            <p>Daniel Schierbeck has been programming in Ruby since 2005 after completing level 99 in PHP and figuring out there was no prize to win after all.</p>
            <p>He studied Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, where he primarily spent his time trying to avoid writing C++. He got into Concurrent Sequential Processes before it became cool, and wrote a Ruby implementation called Minx for his bachelor thesis. As with all academic code, it is used by no one.</p>
            <p>He currently pumps out pull requests for a living at Zendesk, a San Francisco based Customer Support Software SaaS company.</p>
            <h3>Curly — Refactoring the view layer</h3>
            <p>While most parts of Rails have been thoroughly overhauled during the past few years, one part has stubbornly refused improvement. The view layer is still by default using ERB to transform your app’s objects into HTML. Though HAML has gained a lot of traction, it is not a fundamental shift away from ERB, but rather a preference for putting HTML in your Ruby rather than the other way around.</p>
            <p>More recent efforts in the realm of JavaScript have produced Mustache and its ambitious younger brother, Handlebars. While these are more radical in their attempt to separate structure and logic, they still do not feel like native Rails code.</p>
            <p>While trying to solve a seemingly unrelated problem we discovered a design that suddenly enabled us to move past the limitations of ERB. Though different only in subtle ways, it struck just the right balance between integration with Rails and separation of concerns. We called it Curly.</p>
            <p>I will show how we use the same old OO techniques that you already know to clean up our views, making them less prone to bugs, more readable, and more reusable.</p>
            <p>I’ll also show how a seemingly small change of our conceptual model enabled us to add advanced behavior to our view layer without ending with an unmaintainable mess.</p>
            <p>Curly is open source and available at http://github.com/zendesk/curly</p>

            <p>Lance has been a computer nut ever since his dad bought him a VIC 20 in the 1980s. After nearly a decade as a Java developer for companies like Kodak, CNN, and GE, he decided to end his addiction to heavy inheritance, static typing, and coding without tests. These days, he practices clean Ruby living with lots of well-tested code, class composition, and fun dynamic languages as a developer/startup CTO for hire with extensive experience in data science and committer on open source projects such as the Passbook-iOS, Asari and Active Asari Gems. He is known to practice interspecies pair (purr) programming with his orange tabby, Allie, and when he's not writing code, you will find him diving with sharks, trekking through Chernobyl, sampling wine, cheering on the Springboks or perfecting his biltong recipe.</p>
            <h3>Analytics for the Busy Ruby Developer</h3>
            <p>Our applications have the potential to produce a lot of data. Every time a user clicks a button, buys something, or our application does any number of things we have the opportunity to gain useful insights. But where do you begin? Should I gather every data point I can think of? What tools work the best? There is a lot of talk and hype about analytics. In this session, let's take a look at what goes into mining data and analyzing the insights. We'll discuss different approaches to gathering, storing, and querying data, how to determine the KPIs to focus on, and how to interpret and use information in meaningful ways. While you may not be a statistician, see how some basic statistics can help you to start to wrangle your data.</p>

            <p>Newcomer or seasoned veteran looking to get involved with Ruby documentation?</p>
            <p>The path to eternal gratification can seem like a scary one, but we'll show you it's alot easier than you thought. Writing documentation is a great way to give back to the open source community and build your Ruby skills and fundamentals.</p>
            <p>This talk will teach you the value of open-source, the benefits of contributing, and a little bit about how ruby-core works. You will learn what to look for when spotting documentation bugs in the CRuby source code. We will cover the guidelines to writing CRuby documentation, and how to submit a patch.</p>

            <p>Ruby fan since 2004, Rails since 2005. Code since 1989. HTML since 3.2 was shiny and new. Javascript for too long. BSc Computer Science and Economics. Also studied Philosophy, Physics, Comparative Literature and Music.</p>
            <h3>What is an object, really?</h3>
            <p>OR</p>
            <h3>When is an object actually a function?</h3>
            <p>Programming languages exist to allow programmers to make sense of complex real-world problems. What real world scenarios lend themselves to modelling by objects, and which to functions?</p>
            <p>The first time I met objects was in Turbo Pascal in about 1990. I was completely baffled. I eventually got comfortable with objects in c++, and had that turned on its head by Smalltalk. Then Java objects came along and made me write too much code. Ruby was a breath of fresh air, but it took me 8 years before I really grokked the object model in Ruby. Lately with all the interest in functional languages, I've been glimpsing some overlaps between functions and objects.</p>
            <p>I'm still not sure if CLOS is a good idea though.</p>
            <p>Accompanied by real-world code examples in Ruby, naturally.</p>

            <p>I have been doing TDD for several years and of late, I have been left with the feeling that I am missing some key part of the value that it supposed to offer. This talk will cover some (not enough time for all) of the n00b mistakes I have made in the past, and I will try and present a TDD strategy that works for me and may help inform improvements in the way others approach their tests.</p>

            <h3>Clean Code: Applying Object Oriented Principles</h3>
            <p>Ruby gives us a lot of freedom when expressing code and draws features from various paradigms, but it's an object oriented language at heart. In this session we'll go back to first principles of object oriented programming and see how applying object inheritance, polymorphism and a bit of discipline can translate into an understandable and maintainable codebase.</p>

            <p>Robert has been coding for 15 years and is still not dead. Having worked in all facets of web development for a wide variety of use cases and people, he is happily astonished at how much fun he's still having, thanks in no small part to the Clojure language and its philosophy and community.</p>
            <h3>Immutable Data...base?</h3>
            <p>We’ll take a whirlwind tour through Clojure - the rapidly rising functional language on the JVM - and Datomic, a novel take on immutable databases. We’ll see how the notion of immutability makes life as a working programmer a lot easier in Clojure, and in Datomic, how it becomes possible to query the past, query against what-if databases, query across databases, and more.</p>

            <h3>Persistent data structures - good for UI</h3>
            <p>Persistent data structures are being imported from the FP world.</p>
            <p>What makes persistent data structures particularly interesting is that they cannot be modified in the traditional sense. These structures can model a timeline of changes quite naturally since every "change" creates a new "copy".</p>
            <p>"Functional Reactive Programming" is another old/new idea. FRP has a time centric viewpoint.</p>
            <p>Having persistent data structures on the Javascript/UI side of the world unlocks a lot of the magic that FRP has to offer.</p>
            <p>In this talk Danie will explain why persistent data structures are good and specifically why they are good for (the) UI.</p>

          <div class='inner'>
            <p>I worked for many years in Visual Basic 6, then, in 2008, changed jobs resulting in a magical transformation of my career. A patient guy took me under his wing and taught me Linux, Python, Django, MVC and developing the full web stack. That was almost 5 years ago. Last year, I took a job as a Ruby/Rails Developer and I've learnt a lot about developing the Rails way (services, policies, etc). Learning another framework is hugely challenging but interesting in allowing you to see how the same problems can be solved in different ways (routing, controllers, template rendering, etc.).</p>
            <h3>Debugging in Ruby on Rails</h3>
            <p>Great tools are key to great development and an awesome console and interactive debugger are up there on the list of tools EVERY developer should have access to. In particular, Pry and the Jazz Hands bundle that includes a few goodies with Pry (mostly, other Pry plugins) bring a very useful console for code exploration and a debugger that you can enter during any code execution, whether the app is running daemonised or not. It's not hard to use Pry but I'm astonished by how many developers deprive themselves of this absolute must-have tool.</p>

            <h2>Designing and building a distributed application using AWS services</h2>
            <p>Amazon Web Services is pleased to present a workshop in Cape Town the weekend before the Rubyfuza conference. The hack-day will provide hands-on experience designing and building a fun distributed application using AWS services.</p>
            <p>The workshop is aimed at seasoned developers. Prior experience using AWS and our SDKs will be to your advantage; however they are well documented and easy to learn in the time you have available.</p>
            <p>We'll be building a procedural music generator. You'll build up a library of sound samples by interacting with a variety of AWS services, learning AWS best practices along the way, and combine those samples into a piece of music.</p>
            <p>Engineers from AWS will be on hand to help you design and build your system. They'll be doing the judging and will award some great prizes for the best piece of music, and the most creative applications.</p>
            <p>We will credit your AWS account with enough money to build your application, as well as play with AWS services after the workshop.</p>
            <h4>Prerequisites:</h4>
            <ul class='list'>
              <li>Your own AWS account - this requires a credit-card, and it will not be possible to sign up for an account on the day. Please don't use one from your employer!</li>
              <li>A laptop with a development environment for your favourite language already configured</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It's important that you sign up for an AWS account before the event - please drop us an email at
              <a href='mailto:aws-rubyfuza@amazon.com'>aws-rubyfuza@amazon.com</a>
              with your 12-digit AWS account ID so we can credit your account.

            <h2>An Introduction to Functional Programming for Ruby Developers</h2>
            <p>There is a lot of buzz and hype around functional programming at the moment.  Many claiming it is the only way to scale and write safe code in our multi-core world.  Some of it is true and some of it is hype.  What I've learnt is that functional programming makes us better object oriented developers.  On more than one occasion, FP has offered us a cleaner, sweeter solutions to non-trivial problems.  In this workshop, we will give a hands-on introduction to the main themes of FP, cutting through the hype, favouring practice over theory.  We will play with a few languages like Clojure, Scala, JavaScript (yes!) and maybe Haskell or F# too.  So bring your laptop along and join in.</p>

              Aslam Khan is a software developer for more years than South Africa is a democracy.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code as an expression of design. And the same goes for architecture too - it's all design.  The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very hard.  As developers we need thinking tools, and different paradigms gives us that diversity, hence his interest in functional programming.  He is currently writing a book on functional programming for Manning.  If that doesn't bore you, then try his blog at

            <p>Most software companies are trying some form of an agile process these days, but often people follow the mechanics without understanding the reasons behind why certain things are done.</p>
            <p>Join us for a Scrum simulation using LEGO. We will build a product that needs to ship at the end of 2 sprints. We’ll go through each of the Scrum meetings: Backlog Grooming, Sprint Planning parts 1 & 2, Sprint Review and Sprint Retro. First we’ll explain the purpose of the meeting so you understand the reason for doing it, then you’ll get to do it, re-enforcing the learning.</p>
            <p>Even if you’ve been doing Scrum for some time, this will be a great refresher of the basics and an opportunity to ask questions about some of the subtleties of Scrum.</p>

          <p>In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.</p>

          <p>
            Polyglot Programming is an Atlanta based software company with strong
            South African ties. Managing partners Lance and Marlene, an
            ex-Pretorian, lead a team of developers who are passionate about Ruby
            on Rails and other best in breed technologies. We work with startups
            and companies to develop prototypes, launch ideas, scale existing web
            applications and supplement internal development teams. Our Agile
            development process focuses on testing and ensures that we deliver
            feature-rich applications quickly and within budget. When they're not
            writing code, you'll find the team "purr programming" with resident
            company cat Allie or sampling wine and cheering for the Springboks.

          <p>Wow, I can't believe it's been more than six months since Rubyfuza. And that means it's less than six months until the next one. Well, we've started planning and things will start coming together slowly over the next few weeks..</p>

          <p>My wife asked me "What are you most excited about at this year's conference?" That's a really tough question for me to answer, but I think the thing that I'm most excited about are the RailsBridge workshops...</p>
